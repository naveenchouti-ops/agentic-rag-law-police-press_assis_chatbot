III. Methodology and Major Data Sources:
Provisional and Quarterly Estimates of National Income are compiled using the benchmark-
indicator method i.e. the estimates available for the previous year (2022-23) are extrapolated using
the relevant indicators reflecting the performance of sectors. The Second Advance Estimates (SAE)
of National Income for the year 2023-24 were released on 29th February, 2024. These estimates have
7

This Press Release is embargoed against publication, telecast or circulation on internet till 5.30 pm on 31st May, 2024.
now been revised incorporating latest information on relevant indicators in the financial year.
The sector-wise estimates have been compiled using indicators/data sources like (i) Index of
Industrial Production (IIP), (ii) Financial performance of Listed Companies in the Private Corporate
sector based on available quarterly financial results of these companies for 2023-24, (iii) Advance
Estimates of Crop Production for 2023-24, (iv) Production of Major Livestock Products for 2023-
24, (v) Fish Production, (vi) Production/ Consumption of Cement and Steel, (vii) Net Tonne
Kilometres and Passenger Kilometres for Railways, (viii) Passenger and Cargo traffic handled by
Civil Aviation, (ix) Cargo traffic handled at Major and Minor Sea Ports, (x) Sales of Commercial
Vehicles, (xi) Bank Deposits & Credits, (xii) Accounts of Central & State Governments, etc.,
available for the financial year 2023-24. Year-on-Year growth rates (%) in the main indicators used
in the estimation are given in the Annexure B.
Total tax revenue used for GDP compilation includes non-GST revenue as well as GST
revenue. Latest available information from Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and Comptroller
and Auditor General of India (CAG) have been used for estimating taxes on products at Current
Prices. For compiling taxes on products at constant prices, volume extrapolation is done using
volume growth of taxed goods and services. The total product subsidies were compiled using the
latest information on major subsidies viz. Food, Urea, Petroleum and Nutrient based subsidy for
Centre and the expenditure incurred on subsidies by most States up to March, 2024 along with the
Centre/State-wise RE and BE Provision for 2023-24. Information on Revenue expenditure, Interest
payments, Subsidies etc. from Centre and States for 2023-24 are used for estimating Government
Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE).
Improved data coverage and revision in input data made by source agencies would have a
bearing on subsequent revisions of these estimates. Estimates are, therefore, likely to undergo
revisions for the aforesaid causes in due course, as per the release calendar. Users should take these
into consideration while interpreting the figures. The next release of quarterly GDP estimates for the
quarter April-June of 2024-25 (Q1 2024-25) will be on 30.08.2024.
